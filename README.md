# UVM-ML-RPS-Project
This project was designed my senior year alongside Elliott Gear and James Doherty as part of our Biomedical Instrumentation class. The purpose was to use machine learning concepts and EMG data collected by an arduino board to analyze actions taken in a game of Rock Paper Scissors and use the classifier developed by the training data to determine which action was taken. In this repository is the code and data used for this project. This is being stored here for my own purposes of archiving and demonstration of familiarity with such concepts.
